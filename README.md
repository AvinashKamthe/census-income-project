Project Summary: Predicting Income Level Using Machine Learning

Problem Statement:
This project aims to predict whether an individual earns over $50,000 per year based on various demographic and socioeconomic features. The task involves preprocessing the data, exploring key insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying different machine learning algorithms for classification.

Tasks Completed:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables as necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive EDA to understand the distribution and relationships of variables. Key insights were visualized using graphs and charts to identify patterns and correlations.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented several machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict the income level. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Model Selection: Identified the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and fine-tuned hyperparameters where necessary to improve prediction accuracy.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques to solve a classification problem of predicting income levels. The findings and methodologies can be extended to similar prediction tasks in socioeconomic studies and business analytics.
